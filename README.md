# Bar Chart
This repository contains code for creating a bar chart using D3.js and XMLHttpRequest. The code fetches data from a JSON file and generates a bar chart based on that data.

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following:
- A web browser that supports D3.js and XMLHttpRequest.
- D3.js library.

## Usage
Follow the instructions below to use the code:

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.

2. Include the D3.js library in your HTML file:

   ```html
   <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v6.min.js"></script>
3. Open the HTML file that contains the code.

4. Find the following code snippet in the JavaScript section of the HTML file:
   ```html
   let url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/GDP-data.json";
   let req = new XMLHttpRequest();
   // Rest of the code...
   ```
   Replace the url variable value with the URL of your JSON data file.

5. Run the HTML file in your web browser.

## Code Explanation
The code performs the following steps:
1. It defines variables and scales necessary for the chart.

2. It creates a function to draw the SVG canvas.

3. It creates a function to generate scales for the chart.

4. It creates a function to draw the bars of the chart.

5. It creates a function to generate the x-axis and y-axis of the chart.
